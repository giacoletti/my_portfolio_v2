## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn cypress`

Runs the app with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), the next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.
